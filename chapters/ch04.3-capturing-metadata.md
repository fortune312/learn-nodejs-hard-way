# Capturing metadata

The `Logger` is writing to the file, like we expected but there's an issue. It's not capturing any useful meta data. Here's what our logs look like

```
Hello this is a log of type ERROR
```

This is no different than a normal `console.log` method. We could do something like this -

```js

const logger = /* init logger */

function create_subscription() {
    const my_log_message = 'This is an error'
    logger.error(`[Error]: create_subscription() Line No. 69 ${my_log_message}`);       
}
```

This works. What if you add more functionality above this function in the same file? Do you keep changing the line number again and again?

This looks really bad for something that's pretending to be a "logging library". We need to make sure we do all the heavy lifting for our clients, than having them to type out the unnecessary stuff.

We want the clients to only call our `logger.error` or any other method like this

```bash
function my_deeply_nested_api_route() {
    logger.error('my error')
    logger.warn('my warning')
}
```

and the output should be something like this

```bash
[2023-08-19T15:10:37.097Z] [ERROR]: (/Users/ishtmeet/Code/logtar/test.js:12) my_deeply_nested_api_route() my error
[2023-08-19T15:10:37.097Z] [ERROR]: /Users/ishtmeet/Code/logtar/test.js:13 my_deeply_nested_api_route() my warning
```

How cool would it be? Let's achieve this functionality with a little bit of javascript hack.

Before we jump into the details on how we can extract the function name or it's line number, let's take a small break to understand what a `call stack` is. But before understanding what a `call stack` is we need to understand what a `stack` is.

## What is a Stack?

A stack is a data structure that is widely used in in programming. It is designed to store a collection of elements and is based on the [Last In First Out (LIFO) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)#:~:text=The%20order%20in%20which%20an%20element%20added%20to%20or%20removed%20from%20a%20stack%20is%20described%20as%20last%20in%2C%20first%20out%2C%20referred%20to%20by%20the%20acronym%20LIFO.%5Bnb%201%5D). This means that the most recently added element to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Stacks are used in a variety of applications, from handling function calls to undoing/redoing actions in software applications. Stacks can also be implemented in different ways, such as using arrays or linked lists.

## Examples of Stacks

Stacks are a common occurrence in everyday life, and here are some examples:

- A stack of books
- A stack of files
- A stack of pizzas

In each of these cases, the most recent item is placed on top of the stack while the oldest is located at the bottom. For example, to access the pizza at the bottom, you will need to remove all the pizzas above it in the stack.

## The Call Stack

A call stack is a special type of stack that keeps track of function calls. Whenever a function is called, its information is pushed onto the call stack. When the function returns, its information is popped off the stack.

Here is an example of a call stack in JavaScript:

```jsx
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function calculate() {
  const x = 10;
  const y = 5;

  const result1 = add(x, y);
  const result2 = multiply(add(1, 2), result1);

  return result2;
}

calculate();
```

In the example provided, the `calculate` function calls two other functions (`add` and `multiply`). Each time a function is called, its information is added to the call stack. When a function returns, its information is removed from the stack.

To further illustrate this, consider the following graphic:

![call stack](/assets/imgs/call-stack.png)

When the `calculate` function is called, its information is added to the top of the stack. The function then calls the `add` function, which adds its information to the top of the stack. The `add` function then returns, and its information is removed from the stack. The `multiply` function is then called, and its information is added to the top of the stack. 

One important thing to note is, when multiply is called, the first argument is a call to `add(1, 2)`. That means we need to push the `add(..)` back to the top, above `multiply` in the call stack. When the `add` finishes executing, it's  removed from the top.

This process continues, with each function call adding its information to the top of the stack and returning, with its information being removed from the stack.

This call stack is important because it allows the program to keep track of where it is in the execution of a program. If a function call is not properly removed from the stack, it can cause a stack overflow error, which can crash the program.

> In compiled languages like C++ or Rust, the compiler is smart enough to inline the `add()` function above, and directly place the contents of the `add` function in the place of the function call. This can result in performance improvements by eliminating the overhead of a function call and return.
